# K-means clustering demo

This is a demo of k-means clustering using R. A list of animals is clustered together into groups based on their shared featuresets. It's a useful method in wide variety of situations, for example in data exploration or customer segmentation. 

## Methodology and data



The dataset contains 85 features, such as "big", "small", and "hairless", of 50 animals. The data is numerical and continous, and has no missing values. Of the same dataset there also exists a dataset of binary values, which can be useful in other types of classification techniques. Predicates.txt contains the full feature list, classes.txt contains the names of the observations, and predicate-matrix-continuous.txt contains the numerical data associated with the classes.
